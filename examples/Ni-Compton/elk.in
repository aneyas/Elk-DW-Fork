! Twice-integrated electron momentum density (EMD) plot for ferromagnetic Ni.
! This can be compared directly with the experimental Compton profile.

! First the EMD is calculated on a regular H+k grid. This is then interpolated
! and integrated in directions which are mutually orthogonal to each other and
! along the plotting line. This line is given by plot1d.

! Example by David Ernsting and Stephen Dugdale.
